<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>When "Add PacMan" button is pressed it positions a pacman viewable on the page. A new pacman image is positioned and added to the "game" div every single time the "Add PacMan" button is pressed. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman. The pacmen move when "Start Game" is pressed and bounces off any wall they hit.</p>
